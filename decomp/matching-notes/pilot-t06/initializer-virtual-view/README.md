# Initializer: declaration-only virtual view and physical flags construction

`func_0206c244` at main `0x0206c244` remains an original reference function. These 60 strict object trials accepted no source. They do not change the canonical source manifest, delink metadata, coverage, or ROM. The experiment starts from `b7a3edc`, which preserves the previous ordinary function-pointer dispatch attempt. Root's separately verified constructor milestone remains authoritative.

The complete original TU is 596 bytes (532 instruction bytes and 64 pool bytes), ending at `0x0206c498`. Its SHA256 is pinned in each context manifest. The target publication is [targets.json](../targets.json); the observed calls, fields, and uncertainties are recorded in [common-effect-contracts](../common-effect-contracts/README.md). Original instructions and extracted objects remain private.

## Settled receiver improvement

`resource_view.cpp` declares a resource ABI view with five reserved virtual slots followed by the observed slot `+0x14`, and physically guards the resource field `+0x38`. It does not instantiate this view, define any view methods, declare inheritance, or emit RTTI, helpers, or data. The original external symbol `func_02035e88` returns a pointer with this candidate ABI view. This is a compiler-lowering experiment, not recovery of the original resource class or a proof of its complete method signature. Registers not explicitly prepared at the call may still carry arguments consumed by the callee.

At `-O2`, the declaration-only call reproduces the original vptr load at TU `+0x64` / main `0x0206c2a8`: receiver `r0`, vptr temporary `r1`, then slot `+0x14`. The preceding attempt used a different receiver register. The current object contains only `.text` and only `func_0206c244`, with its original 596-byte extent.

Three saved source forms preserve this improvement:

| Form | Flags-constructor address argument view |
| --- | --- |
| `resource_view.cpp` | `Flags*`, `const char*`, `const char*` |
| `word_addresses.cpp` | `Flags*`, 32-bit address words |
| `opaque_addresses.cpp` | `void*`, `const void*`, `const void*` |

All forms retain the same original symbol identities, semantic argument order, and both intermediate/final vptr stores. Each was compiled under 14 saved contexts: default, `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O2,p`, `-O3,p`, `-O4,p`, and `-O4,s`, each with default or explicit interworking settings. All 42 trials fail the complete-object gate. Thirty have the closest 596-byte output described below. Six fail function extent/identity checks and six fail initialized bytes with an otherwise matching relocation inventory.

## Remaining constructor argument and pool order

The closest declaration-only-view objects differ at masked TU byte offsets `449` and `453`. These belong to the instructions starting at TU `+0x1c0` and `+0x1c4`, main `0x0206c404` and `0x0206c408`. The original loads label argument `r2` before key argument `r1`; the candidates load key `r1` before label `r2`.

The corresponding pool relocations are also reversed:

| TU pool offset | Original ABS32 target | Closest candidate target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `580` / `0x244` | `data_0209e26c` (label) | `data_0209e280` (key) |
| `584` / `0x248` | `data_0209e280` (key) | `data_0209e26c` (label) |

Both pass the same semantic arguments to original `func_0202c4ac`: storage in `r0`, key in `r1`, label in `r2`. Equal call-time values do not satisfy the exact object gate. Relocation destinations remain compared; this report does not mask their disagreement.

## Bounded physical constructor hypothesis

After completing the 42-trial view sweep, `flags_constructor.cpp` tests an inline constructor on the explicit physical `Flags` record. Header-free placement construction wraps original `func_0202c4ac(this, key, label)`, preserves the original string identities, writes the original intermediate vptr, initializes the four words and the `+0x24` word, and writes the original final vptr. It introduces no inheritance or inferred ownership. It adds no safety guard to the original non-null allocation branch.

The 14 original contexts and four additional documented contexts (`-inline all`, `-inline on,level=8`, `-inline all,level=8,bottomup`, and `-ipa file -inline all`, all with `-O2`) accept no object:

- Eleven emit an additional allocated `.text` containing `Flags`' constructor. At `-O2`, the initializer is 548 bytes and the separate constructor is 72 bytes. The strict gate rejects duplicate allocated `.text` sections; no helper is discarded.
- Seven inline the constructor, emit only the initializer, and produce 600 bytes against the original 596. They retain key-before-label pool order and additional instruction/load differences.

This concludes the chosen constructor shape. An exact source needs a grounded source shape or compiler context that reproduces the original argument lowering without instruction patches, register/volatile hints, semantic argument reordering, symbol substitutions, or removal of emitted sections. This experiment supplies none. No full ROM run was attempted because every source object failed the preceding gate.

## Verification and reproduction

The pinned compiler is package `2.0/base` (`3.0 build 114`), with its binary/runtime-library hashes taken from `decomp/toolchain.lock.json`; the pinned runner is Wibo `1.2.0` under the existing macOS compatibility path. CPU is `arm946e`, ARM/little-endian/32-bit ABI, `-Cpp_exceptions off`, and `-nostdinc`. All four saved sources are header-free, with empty header/include sets. Each report records the actual compiler commands, source/tool/reference hashes, section/function metadata, relocation identities, strict failures, and masked mismatch positions. Context manifests pin source contents before and after compilation.

Run the focused actual-tool tests:

```sh
JUS_INIT_MWCC=/absolute/path/mwccarm.exe \
JUS_INIT_WIBO=/absolute/path/wibo-macos \
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/matching -p test_initializer_virtual_view.py -v
```

The six tests include actual compiler rejection of shifted physical layouts; an extra reserved slot rejected by initialized-byte comparison; changed table/call/key/constructor destinations rejected by relocation comparison; and rejection of an emitted extra constructor without discarding its section. Tests mutate private source copies. The view tests first failed because their candidate was absent; the constructor tests first failed for the same reason. All six now pass with the actual pinned tools. The full matching suite passes 220 tests with 11 unrelated optional-tool tests skipped; the six new tests all ran.

Use a private complete reference TU generated with dsd's saved delink entry and matching hash. Run each sweep into a fresh ignored directory:

```sh
python3 decomp/matching-notes/pilot-t06/initializer-virtual-view/reproduce.py \
  --compiler /absolute/path/mwccarm.exe --runner /absolute/path/wibo-macos \
  --reference-dir /private/path/delinks --output build/initializer-view-rerun
```

Add `--contexts decomp/matching-notes/pilot-t06/initializer-virtual-view/constructor-contexts.json` for the 14 constructor contexts or `constructor-inline-contexts.json` for the four additional contexts, each with a fresh output directory. The reference directory must contain `src/main/common_effect_init.o` matching the saved reference SHA256.

The three `*-report.json` files record all 60 completed strict trials. `verification.json` also records the four preliminary `-O2` inspections and the first constructor sweep's reporting abort after one successful compile: the reporter initially assumed unique section names, then gained a metadata-only fallback retaining the complete rejected inventory. That aborted reporter run is recorded separately from the 60 completed matrix trials. No tool/source binaries or original byte payloads are published.
