# Other executable bootstrap: T10 remains open

This bootstrap verifies preserved original bytes and fresh extraction. It establishes no linked baseline or source promotion for these programs. `residual-executables.json` imports the exact T01 inventory and records its SHA256. Source credit is zero, and the global coverage percentage remains unknown.

| Program | CPU | Stored bytes | Remaining source work |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Parent ROM | ARM7 | 165,552 | Entire executable; sections, functions, relocations and ABI unresolved |
| `ChildRom/JSS2Child.srl` | ARM9 | 1,955,956 | Entire compressed executable; strict analysis fails |
| `ChildRom/JSS2Child.srl` | ARM7 | 165,552 | Entire executable; sections, functions, relocations and ABI unresolved |

The two ARM7 payloads are byte-identical. They remain separate program instances with separate program hashes and CPU identities. ARM7 stored ranges are recorded as offsets within the executable, without inferring expanded RAM sections or BSS.

The child ARM9 expands to 2,628,408 bytes: main 2,624,320, ITCM 3,968, DTCM 96, and a 24-byte autoload table. Its main BSS is 105,760 bytes, and DTCM BSS is 32 bytes. These values come from the original module parameters and autoload table. The inventory retains the SDK word `0x03017534`; no ARM7 SDK version is inferred from it.

Fresh pinned dsd extraction reproduces both ARM7 hashes and the child ARM9 modules. dsd clears the child's `compressed_static_end` word during extraction. The comparison restores only that documented word from pinned metadata; every other module byte must match. Both the raw extracted hash and the compared original-domain hash are retained.

The pinned dsd revision `9f6c1b11c8f4b384ffcdc75b2c6d863cd371dcfe` supports ARM7 ROM extraction, but its analysis and delink model supports only ARM9. Its `ModuleKind` has no ARM7 variant, and its function parser fixes the ISA to ARMv5TE. Exact source files and line references are in the ledger. Strict child ARM9 initialization also fails: the call at `0x020ae19e` targets `0x02000822`, where no function was found. No relaxed unknown-call analysis was used.

`cpu-policy-probes.json` records independent selection of `arm7tdmi` and ARMv4T with the pinned compiler and runner. The invented `public_cpu_probe.c` compiles in both explicit ARM and Thumb modes. This proves compiler target support, with zero original source credit. Original ARM7 compiler, ABI, SDK signatures and link metadata remain unresolved.

## Reproduce preserved-scope checks

Set `ROM` to the private original ROM, `DSD` to the pinned dsd executable, and `BUILD` to a fresh ignored build directory. Run from the repository root:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/matching -p test_other_executables.py
python3 tools/scripts/other_executables.py --rom "$ROM" --inventory decomp/matching-notes/baseline-t01/executable-regions.json --output "$BUILD/scope.json"
"$DSD" rom extract --rom "$ROM" --output-path "$BUILD/parent"
"$DSD" rom extract --rom "$BUILD/parent/files/ChildRom/JSS2Child.srl" --output-path "$BUILD/child"
"$DSD" init --rom-config "$BUILD/child/config.yaml" --output-path "$BUILD/child-analysis" --build-path "$BUILD/child-build"
```

The last command exits with status 1 at the unresolved child call. The standalone scope command does not run extraction or grant verification-pipeline credit. Its input inventory is trusted pinned metadata supplied by the caller. `verify_extracted_payload` compares actual fresh ARM7 bytes; `verify_extracted_arm9_modules` compares the child module files. `probe_cpu_compiler` checks actual compiler, runner and source hashes before and after compilation, requires explicit CPU and instruction mode, and inspects the resulting ELF functions.

T10 still requires ARM7 analysis and relocation metadata, independent original compiler matching, linked baselines, source promotion of every residual interval, and recursive executable discovery in proprietary asset containers. Remaining function and symbol counts are unknown, not zero. Emulator smoke testing belongs to T07 and was not run here.
